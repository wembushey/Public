This is what I would call a 0.1 Alpha release.
It is capable of making a controler and remote worker node and deploing the genaric nginx webserver.

Problems include:
Just not working somtimes for unknown reasons.
Being super slow.
Being insecure with keys.
Being a poorly wrighten.

Do not use this for anything beyond a test in a homelab. Problems are expected with these scripts so use them at your own risk.
